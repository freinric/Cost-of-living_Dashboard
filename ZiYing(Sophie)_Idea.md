# Vancouver Greenest City Action Plan
The Greenest City Action Plan will let Vancouver residents enjoy unparalleled green space, build the most spectacular urban forest in the world.   
Specific indicators: 
1. In 2020, secure everyone a place within a 5-minute walk access to parks, greenways, or other green spaces within the distance  
```5 minute walk is around one quarter mile, maybe we can divide the area with squares and add parks and greenway info into the map to check ```
- Public green land area
    - [Parks](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/parks/table/) includes the surface area of each parks
    - [Greenways](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/greenways/information/) with two status: active, proposed 


2. Restore or increase 25 hectares of nature reserves natural area

## Project Dataset:
The dataset is a list of projects that are part of the initiatives under the Greenest City 2020 Action Plan.  
There are 4 categories of projects: City projects, City Studio projects, Greenest City Fund projects and Private projects.  All projects are also categorized by one of the ten Greenest City goals. For projects to be included they must be a substantial project located in Vancouver, initiated since the formation of the Greenest City Action Team (2010), and contribute to a Greenest City goal.

- [Greenest City projects](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/greenest-city-projects/information/) there is no timeline for these projects.
