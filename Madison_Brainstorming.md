## Proposal

Madison Brainstorming -

1 - forest fires in BC - interactive dashboard for past fires, and could be used for active fires during the fire season for BC residents
*** conditional on if we learn how to do maps, because that would be the coolest feature - https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/wildfire-statistics

2 - National forest fire database - http://nfdp.ccfm.org/en/data/fires.php

3 - Canadian Environment data including air/climate, environmental economic, environmental protection tech, ecosystems & biodiversity, natural disasters, waste, water
All found via this general link here - https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/environment
Full disclosure, they have 'dashboards' available on the website, but they're through PowerBI and they kinda suck, so creating one would be a huge value add to make it actually functional.

4 - Historical Climate Data - https://climate.weather.gc.ca/
Split up by Province/Region but we could web scrape and combine them all, then create the dashboard to compare changes over time?
